	The PushEventButton captures each individual button press as discrete events.  It
	does not matter how long the button is pressed down or released.  Only the transition
	between pressed and released is captured.

	Either the push or the release event can be detected.
*/

/*
	To use a button with this library, the button should be wired with one side
	connected to the Arduino pin and the other side connected to ground such that
	when the button is pressed, the pin is brought to ground (LOW).
